	<h1>YOUNG AMERICAN SONGWRITER - a dive into the music of David Hale</h2>
	<img src="hale.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="David Hale on his drum kit">
	<p>Firstly, let's start with some basic facts about David Hale:</i>
	<ul><li>He hails from Albuquerque, New Mexico in USA</li>
	<li>He's a drummer and a producer</li>
	<li>His father is also a music producer, and he was the first to show him the ropes</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It's a common assumption that contemporary and ambitious songwriters aren't left with much field to show off their skills as composers. 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s were undoubtedly the 	greatest
	decades for music, and so one could presume that there's nothing more that an artist could do to potentially shine among the swiftly manufactured radio-friendly hook-driven music 	which has little
	to do with actual art. Well, the new album by a young aspiring songwriter, David Hale, who's also a very skilled drummer and producer, is bound to contradict that assumption. His 	fully-instrumental debut album Hale Damage from 2019 unashamedly borrows from the sonic landscape of Genesis and the style of their keyboardist - Tony Banks. Hale manages tocapture 	the essence of a one-man band sound, and the musical proficiency is at the forefront in this alluring, even if a bit derivative, love letter to his favourite band - the legendary 	Genesis who are best known for their early 70s discography (progressive songs with Peter Gabriel) as well as the more pop-oriented tracks with Phil Collins from the 70s and 
	<p>In 2021 Something Peculiar was released, which marked a serious shift in the style of his music fortwo reasons. Firstly, it's the first album for which the artist hired an array of vocalists (Seth Cawthon, Alex Chod and Paul Sinwill). That makes every song sound personal, and contrasting vocals offer a diverse listening experience. Secondly, it's his first work that actually employs vocals
(with the exception of an ephemeral instrumental titled Vacillation). Hale even takes up a mic on the album sixth track The Great Deception - a bizarre mix of sinister verses with funky and bouncy
chorus that's intertwined with unbalanced screaming and humorous vocal interludes. The album still evokes the familiar feeling of beautiful progressive passages of Genesis, but this time Hale decides to take on a direction that is more commercial and ultimately more cohesive and appealing to the masses. The overall sound may be reminiscent of Tame Impala's Kevin Parker's musical
achievements but with a greater attention to details and song structures. Something Peculiar establishes itself as an essential part of David Hale's discography with meticulously executed drum beats, well-thought chord sequences and relentessly rhytmical vocal parts. As for the lyrical content, it might come forth as a bit inane, but in the end it all goes down to the premise HEY... IT'S PECULIAR!!!</p>

<p>The young songwriter's latest work titled Business as Usual puts forward a concept that isn't deeply-
rooted in the songs' lyrical side; it's solely a basis for branching out ideas that tackle love, confusion, loss, rejection, entertainment or even a scene of crime. Business was teased by 3 singles:
Vanity Fair, Carnival and Open Secret. The former is instantly appealing - it's cleverly written with plethora of hooks and a catchy chorus. Hale pulls off an interesting poetical metaphor comparing a
lady whose blue eyes, brown hair look somewhat of a vanity fair. The song is written from a perspective of a guy falling for a girl, but not being sure if she's capable of reciprocating the feeling
as she's full of contradictions: she has a city flare, yet she's ice-cold. It's hard not to succumb to the charms of this bumpy track that could move even the stiffest person in the room.
Carnival makes a good use of a mixed approach to the songwriting with a rapped verse and melodic chorus while lyrically it refers to a place of omnipresent pleasure â€“ regardless of whether we mean
physical or a mental one. The exuberance of the track is nicely merged with an energetic saxophone solo performed by Cade Gutierrez. How Could I Carry On? is set in an extremely romantic mood. Hale's low vocal range really serves in favour of propelling the song's lyrical focus on solitude and dealing with abandonment by a loved one: So what can I say?/What can I do? I'm waiting as if
something will change/But I know that you are gone. While the Genesis' influence is really prevalent, it's arguably the album's highlight that takes the listener on a beautiful cruise through
distant seas of sorrow experienced by a recluse. As addictive as the ballad-like quality of How Could I Carry On? might be, the album has got a few surprises in form of guest apperances. Feel it
Creepin' is a joyful and bouncy song that has all the characteristics of a perfect yacht rock record. Vocal delivery of Alex Chod (known as YATTE) is flawless, and one is bound to play this song on a loud speaker, while simultaneously devoting themselves to a Michael Jackson-esque dance in a Miami Vice setting. Another Lie is a Collins-esque stand-out composition because of its aggresive
tone and a very judgemental set of lyrics: The evidence is all against your will/The footprints are throughout the floor/Staggered and leading towards the door/Don't tell me any more but with its
interesting melodical ideas, slowly unfolding musical narrative, and gritty vocals by Paul Sinwill, it catches the listener off guard many times.</p>

<p>Business as Usual finds its creator, David Hale, at his most laid-back and accessible: the compilation of 10 songs that the album is comprised of will delight many musical enthusiasts and fans of cleverly composed songs. His relentless fixation on crystal clear production and synth-driven realm of sound enriched by trademark nostalgia of the 70s/80s sound and acute awareness of the indie musical scene makes this album a universal record to which the listener is attracted right away. It's an amusing ride altogether and we can only wonder what kind of musical tricks the
bedroom songwriter and producer has got up his sleeve for the next release. One thing is certain; his musical career is thriving and his work bridges the gap between what's old and what's new.
But it does so in a way that could make his musical peers jealous.</p>
